In this project, i will design and implement a simple version of a Communication Management and Payment System.

 In the system we have the following objects: Subscriber – Subscribers can communicate each other.
  There are two ways of communication: voice or message communication. Subscribers can also get connected to the Internet via their mobile phones.
   ServiceProvider – ServiceProviders charge Subscribers based on their communication usage.
    Each communication type has a specific cost (voice communication cost, messaging cost, Internet cost). Invoice – It is paid by the Subscriber.
     ServiceProviders record the communication actions of Subscribers and create Invoices based on their communication usage.
