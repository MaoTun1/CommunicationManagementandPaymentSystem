In this project, i will design and implement a simple version of a Communication Management and Payment System.

In the system we have the following objects: Subscriber – Subscribers can communicate each other.
There are two ways of communication: voice or message communication.
Subscribers can also get connected to the Internet via their mobile phones. 
ServiceProvider – ServiceProviders charge Subscribers based on their communication usage.
Each communication type has a specific cost (voice communication cost, messaging cost, Internet cost).
Invoice – It is paid by the Subscriber. ServiceProviders record the communication actions of Subscribers and create Invoices based on their communication usage.

Some rules are given below
